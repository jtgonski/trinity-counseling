                        <p class="text">
                                Trinity Counseling and Consulting was started in 2016 by Caroline von Helms. 
                                Caroline received her undergraduate degree from North Carolina State University 
                                in Raleigh, North Carolina, and her Master's in Marriage and Family Counseling from 
                                Southwestern Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas.  Caroline has been providing counseling 
                                services to individuals, couples, and families since 2000.  She began her career in 
                                Dallas, Texas working with families involved with foster care and those looking to adopt. 
                                She provided services to local schools, children's homes, juvenile probation departments, 
                                and child protective services.  She also maintained a small private practice as well as 
                                taught periodically at a local community college.  Since moving to Raleigh, she was worked 
                                with local churches as well as helping provide supervision for students at Southeastern 
                                Seminary.  She has extensive experience consulting with churches and other non profit 
                                organizations to better their relationships within the organization and form their 
                                counseling ministries.

                                Services provided at Trinity Counseling and Consulting are provided 
                                from a systemic perspective and a Christian worldview.  We do not 
                                discriminate based on age, race,  gender, or religion, but our training 
                                was focused on Christian thought and practice.  Most people who seek out 
                                counseling from us desire this approach and expect to incorporate faith beliefs 
                                into the practice of counseling.
